      Before I even stepped inside, Mt. Fuji was already there,  reflected back
      at me in a pool of water I hadn’t expected to stop for.


      This is part of my larger side quest to Japan. I’ve been in Fuji, more specifically Shin-Fuji, for four days now, and a friend from the hostel convinced me to come to Fujinomiya after hesitating, I’m glad I went.


      We left the hostel at roughly 2:00pm and walked about 20 minutes to Fuji Station, where we boarded the Minobu Line. 6 stops later, we arrived in Fujinomiya. The station itself was similar to standard Japanese stations and they did have this 10/10 bakery, which we’ll come back to.

      The exterior of the Mount Fuji World Heritage Centre was clean and modern,
      with some genuinely cool architecture. Out front was a reflecting pool,
      where you could see Mt. Fuji mirrored in the water. Inside, the entrance
      level housed a café and a gift shop, filled with items that were
      dangerously easy to justify buying.


      As you move through the tour, there’s a lot of information on the history of Mt. Fuji, including a wall of mountains from around the world that were named after it, for example Mt. Etna | Sicily, Italy aka Sicilia-Fuji, and Mt. Ngauruhoe | North Island, New Zealand aka New Zealand-Fuji. There were also several taxidermied animals on display, including Apus pacificus, scientific name being Apodiformes, Apodidae, a Diaphus watasei, scientific name being Myctophiformes, Myctophidae and a Japanese eel, less commonly known as Anguilla japonica or Anguilliformes, Anguillidae.


      One of the most mind-blowing pieces was an interactive globe model, though unfortunately it was under maintenance. I instantly thought, is that a Terravision???which I soon realised it was not. Still, it was insanely exciting, because I didn’t think I would ever see anything similar. I’ll be going back another day just to see if has been repaired.


      On the way out, I bought an Orihon with Mt. Fuji engraved on it (definitely my favourite item I’ve bought so far), along with some stickers and a postcard.

      From there, we boogied on to Fujisan Hongū Sengen Taisha Shrine. It was
      rather pleasant and peaceful, especially in the afternoon when it wasn’t
      very busy. That gave me room to explore, say a prayer, and take some
      photos.


      By this point, I was pretty tired and decided to get food. We ended up at Fujiboku, where I ordered the Louie’s Pork Belly Yakisoba and a Kirin beer. The food was nice, noodles were thinner than what I usually like but I was satisfied.


      The last stop before the train back and another 20 minute walk was the bakery at Fujinomiya Station. It absolutely slapped me in the face and made me say thank you. They had so much on offer I couldn’t tell you half of it so I ordered a Chocolate Crescent, a Red Bean Crescent, and a ham and cheese stuffed bun.


      That amade the 20 minute mission back to Kinoya Hostel fun and just that little bit easier.
