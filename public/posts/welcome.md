description: An introduction to my journey into game development and learning.
---

Welcome to my new blog, where I'll be documenting my adventures in game development.

Over the next few years, I'll be studying game design, building prototypes, and sharing what I learn about engines, tooling, art, and design theory.

I also completed a software engineering bootcamp, landed a creative technologist role about three months after finishing, and did that work for two years. I loved video games as a kid and decided around age 10–12 that it was what I wanted to do. Now I'm here, finally making it real.
