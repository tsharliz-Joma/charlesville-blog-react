description: An introduction to my journey into game development and learning.
---

Welcome to my new blog, where I'll be documenting my adventures in game development.

Over the next few years, I'll be studying game design, building prototypes, and sharing what I learn about engines, tooling, art, and design theory. This site is built with **React**, styled with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) components, and powered by [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org) for easy content management. Feel free to follow along as I level‑up my skills!
