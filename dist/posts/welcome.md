      Welcome to my new blog, where I'll be documenting my adventures in game
      development.

      Over the next few years, I'll be studying game design, building prototypes, and sharing what I learn about engines, tooling, art, and design theory.

      I also completed a software engineering bootcamp, landed a creative technologist role about three months after finishing, and did that work for two years. I loved video games as a kid and decided around age 10–12 that it was what I wanted to do. Now I'm here, finally making it real.


      Why this journal exists

      I'm keeping this journal to document what I'm learning, what I'm building, and what changes as I improve. If you're into game design or just curious about the process, I hope these notes are useful.

      Some games and creators that shaped how I think about design:
      Favorite game or series
      Studio or creator I admire
      A design principle I want to learn
